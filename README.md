# DESCRIPTION

# FRONTEND

I've used single-spa by Canopy Tax. This allows the developers to use the framework / ui library that is most familiar to them which adds the challenge and opportunity to learn new languages and in the case the language gets outdated it is easier to update the component which makes the application very flexible and future proof as there is advantages and disadvantages that comes with every framework / ui library and just using one makes the application very limited. 

# HOW TO RUN

Execute in terminal the command "make run"
